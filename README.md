## 📜 Project Details

- **Project Title:** Roman Numerals to Words Conversion  
- **Course:** ITE19  
- **Description:** This program accepts Roman numerals as input, processes them, and outputs their corresponding English word representation. It also supports arithmetic operations involving Roman numerals, providing the results in words.  

---

## 📂 File Structure

- `main.c` - The core logic for numeral conversion and file processing.  
- `input.txt` - Input file containing Roman numerals or arithmetic expressions.  
- `output.txt` - Output file with word representation of the results or error messages.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program reads **Roman Numerals** or **arithmetic expressions** from the input file (`input.txt`).  
2. Valid Roman numerals are converted to English words.  
3. Valid expressions (e.g., `X + V`) are evaluated, and the result is converted to words.  
4. Invalid inputs are flagged and logged as errors in the output file (`output.txt`).

## 🛠 Features

- 🧮 **Roman Numeral Conversion**: Converts Roman numerals to integers and then to English words.  
- ✍️ **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with Roman numeral operands.  
- 🛡 **Input Validation**: Ensures Roman numerals and expressions are valid.  
- 📁 **File Handling**: Processes input from a file and generates output in a separate file.
